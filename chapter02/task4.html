    <h1>The Gardener</h1>
    <h4>by</b> Robert Louis Stevenson<b></b></p>
        <hr style="height: 5px; background-color: rgb(122, 2, 18);">
    <pre style="font-family: 'Courier New', Courier, monospace;">
He gardener does not love to talk,
He makes me keep the gravel walk;
And when he puts his tools away,
He locks the door and takes the key.
...
Well now, and while the summer stays,
To profit by these garden days,
O how much wiser you would be
To play at Indian wars with me!

        Having suffered from tuberculosis for much of his life, Stevenson spent many years traveling in search of a climate 
        that would suit his illness. He finally settled in Samoa, where he died in 1894 and is buried.
